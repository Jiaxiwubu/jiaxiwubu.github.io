I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Emerging Media Studies](https://www.bu.edu/com/academics/emerging-media-studies/phd-in-emerging-media-studies/) at Boston University. 

I was a research fellow for the American Heart Association Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science [(A-TRAC)](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/a-trac/meet-our-fellows) between 2020-2022, co-mentored by [Dr. Traci Hong](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/traci-hong/) and [Dr. Jessica L. Fetterman](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/jessica-fetterman/).
