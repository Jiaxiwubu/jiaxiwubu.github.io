## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="jiaxi.jpeg">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Emerging Media Studies](https://www.bu.edu/com/academics/emerging-media-studies/phd-in-emerging-media-studies/) in the college of communication at Boston University, advised by [Dr. Traci Hong](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/traci-hong/).

My research interests mainly focus on how to effectively communicate health information in different contexts and through different channels to individuals, especially among youth and underrepresented populations (e.g., people of color; people from a lower socioeconomic status; pregnant people). I have a strong interest in conducting interdisciplinary research among communication, media psychology, and public health. I am interested in both the micro-level process of persuasion, as well as the more macro-level health communication that occurs in society. I use mixed methods, especially quantitative and computational methods to study how communications from advertising campaigns, news reports, social media discussions, and misinformation shape public health issues such as tobacco control and vaccine promotion.  

I was a research fellow for the [American Heart Association Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/a-trac/meet-our-fellows) between 2020-2022, co-mentored by [Dr. Jessica L. Fetterman](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/jessica-fetterman/) and [Dr. Traci Hong](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/traci-hong/).

My fellowship projects primarily interested in how tobacco promotions on emerging social media impact attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to tobacco use among youths and underrepresented populations. Using social media analytics and big data, I studied the promotions of flavored cigar products on social media (i.e., TikTok, Twitter, Instagram), the compliance of health warning requirements in tobacco influencer Instagram posts, the impact of influencers in tobacco promotions, and how such promotions may disproportionately target and influence health perceptions among youth and underrepresented populations.

With the vaping epidemic, my dissertation studies are interested in developing effective vaping prevention and cessation campaigns on TikTok, a youth-appealing social media platform. Specifically, my dissertation focuses on the impact of message frames (loss vs. gain) in anti-vaping campaigns. Previous literature reviews of studies on the message frames have been contradictory and inconsistent. My dissertation seeks to capture the illusive message framing effect by 1) proposing to differentiate between prevention behaviors and cessation behaviors, 2) identifying potential moderators especially at the individual level that may reveal the message framing effect, and 3) investigating the congruency effect between message frames and message kernel states (the description of desirable/undesirable outcomes).
