## Research interests

My **research interests** mainly focus on how to effectively communicate health information in different contexts and through different channels to individuals, especially among youth and underrepresented populations (e.g., people of color; people from a lower socioeconomic status; pregnant people). I have a strong interest in conducting interdisciplinary research among communication, public health, and media psychology. I am interested in both the _micro-level process of persuasion_, as well as the more _macro-level health communication_ that occurs in society. 

I use **mixed methods**, especially _quantitative and computational methods_ to study how communications from advertising campaigns, news reports, social media discussions, and misinformation shape _public health issues_ such as tobacco control and vaccine promotion.

My **[ATRAC fellowship](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/a-trac) projects** primarily interested in how tobacco promotions on emerging social media impact attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to tobacco use among _youths and underrepresented populations_. Using social media analytics and big data, I studied the promotions of flavored cigar products on social media (i.e., TikTok, Twitter, Instagram), the compliance of health warning requirements in tobacco influencer Instagram posts, the impact of influencers in tobacco promotions, and how such promotions may disproportionately target and influence health perceptions among youth and underrepresented populations.

With the vaping epidemic, my **dissertation studies** focus on developing effective _vaping prevention and cessation campaigns on TikTok_, a youth-appealing social media platform. Specifically, my dissertation investigates on the impact of _message frames_ (loss vs. gain) in anti-vaping campaigns. Previous literature reviews of studies on health message frames have reported contradictory and inconsistent findings. My dissertation seeks to capture the illusive message framing effect by 1) proposing to differentiate between prevention behaviors and cessation behaviors, 2) identifying potential moderators especially at the individual level that may reveal the message framing effect, and 3) investigating the congruency effect between message frames and message kernel states (the description of desirable/undesirable outcomes).
